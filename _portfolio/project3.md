**Ninja Sandbox VR** is an Unreal Engine 4 demo about throwing shurikens with modified physics. Utilizing motion controls, the player is required to throw the weapon at procedurally generated balloons. A key highlight is the after effects trail left behind by a thrown shuriken, allowing the player to better understand the trajectory of their prior throw.
